# Concrete5 Clean Block Templates
This repo contains alternate view.php files for C5's built-in Autonav, Form, and Page List blocks. The templates are intended to serve as a starting point for customization by a designer or developer.

The form template is exactly the same as the "Form Tableless Layout" addon available in the C5 marketplace.

The autonav template includes functionality from the "Autonav Exclude Subpages" addon available in the C5 marketplace, as well as some functionality provided by Raverix in this forum thread: http://www.concrete5.org/community/forums/customizing_c5/auto-nav-template-with-unique-css-classes/ . Plus a few other things as well.

All of the templates should work with Concrete5 versions 5.4.1 and 5.4.2. The form and page_list templates have been heavily tested in production, whereas the autonav template is currently somewhat experimental (although the "exclude subpages" functionality has been heavily tested in real-world usage).
